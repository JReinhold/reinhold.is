					For as long as I can remember, I've <em>loved</em> working with
					computers. When I was 11 years old I wanted to learn programming, so I
					grabbed my sister's university-level C++ book and started coding. As I
					reached the concept of <em>classes</em>, I thought to myself:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<i>
						Oh no, I have no idea what's going on here, I'm not smart enough for
						this programming thing.
					</i>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					10 years later, in 2015, when I had gotten bored in the army, and
					started my Computer Science degree, I realised that I actually{' '}
					<em>was</em> smart enough, C++ just wasn't the best language to learn
					as a 11 year old newbie. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
				</p>
				<p>
					I also realised that there was something called{' '}
					<em>Interaction Design/UX/Product Design</em>, and that I'd always had
					a passion for it, I just didn't knew it was a thing. I always thought
					the voice in my head was generally annoyed by the world, when in fact
					all it did was keep pointing out all the mistakes designers had made
					in the environment around me.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my third year at university, I co-founded{' '}
					<a href="https://bambuu.dk" target="_blank">
						bambuu
					</a>{' '}
					with my two buddies{' '}
					<a href="https://twitter.com/GeeWengel" target="_blank">
						Gustav

					and{' '}

					, a digital agency doing web development and design for larger
					corporations that were stuck in their old ways. We had <em>fun</em>{' '}
					and we learned <em>alot</em>, but now we are looking forward to new
					adventures.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've become very aware of my actions and the consequences they have on
					my surroundings. I love the beauty of nature, and I want to spend{' '}
					<em>all</em>
					my energy and skill on making sure we preserve that beauty for future
					generations.
				</p>
				<p>
					It isn't about the earth, it <em>will</em> endure no matter what we do
					to it. It's about my future children, grandchildren, and
					great-grandchildren. It's about making sure that <em>they</em> get to
					experience the same beautiful nature that I do.
