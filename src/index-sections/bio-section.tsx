					For as long as I can remember, I've <em>loved</em> working with
					computers. When I was 11 years old I wanted to learn programming, so I
					grabbed my sister's university-level C++ book and started coding. As I
					reached the concept of <em>classes</em>, I thought to myself:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<i>
						Oh no, I have no idea what's going on here, I'm not smart enough for
						this programming thing.
					</i>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					10 years later, in 2015, when I had gotten bored in the army, and
					started my Computer Science degree, I realised that I actually{' '}
					<em>was</em> smart enough, C++ just wasn't the best language to learn
					as a 11 year old newbie. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
				</p>
				<p>
					I also realised that there was something called{' '}
					<em>Interaction Design/UX/Product Design</em>, and that I'd always had
					a passion for it, I just didn't knew it was a thing. I always thought
					the voice in my head was generally annoyed by the world, when in fact
					all it did was keep pointing out all the mistakes designers had made
					in the environment around me.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my third year at university, I co-founded{' '}

					and we learned <em>a lot</em>, but in the end the consulting business
					wasn't that exciting.

				<p>
					Instead, we moved on an founded{' '}

					, a SaaS with the missions of making waste management more
					environmental friendly. It was a great adventure building our own
					product from scratch. I was in charge of building a kick ass
					administration dashboard in <em>React</em>, along with a
					cross-platform companion app with <em>React Native</em>. We also did
					some consulting on the side, where I built backends in{' '}
					<em>Node.js</em>, while my colleague built the frontend. Unfortunately
