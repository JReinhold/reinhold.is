  <p>
    I could write pages and pages about myself, but that would be useless. True
    value comes in interaction with other people, likeminded or not. So, who do <em
      >you
    </em> think that I am? What defines me, from your perspective?

    Let’s do an exercise. On the paper below, write the first thing that comes
    to mind when you think of me. I’ve written a little something to get you
    started, just don’t get caried away with flattery. ❤️
