<Paragraph>
  For as long as I can remember, I've
  <em>loved</em> working with computers. When I was 11 years old I wanted to
  learn programming, so I grabbed my sister's university-level C++ book and
  started coding. As I reached the concept of <em>classes</em>, I thought to
  myself:
</Paragraph>
<blockquote>
  <i>
    Oh no, I have no idea what's going on here, I'm not smart enough for this
    programming thing.
  </i>
</blockquote>
<h4>A stimulated student</h4>
<Paragraph>
  10 years later, in 2015, when I had gotten bored in the army, and started my
  Computer Science degree, I realised that I actually wasn't
  <em>completely</em> useless, C++ just wasn't the best language to learn as a 11
  year old newbie. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  I also realised that there was something called
  <em>Interaction Design/UX/Product Design</em>, and that I'd always had a
  passion for it, I just didn't knew it was a thing. I always thought the voice
  in my head was generally annoyed by the world, when in fact all it did was
  keep pointing out all the mistakes designers had made in the environment
  around me.

<h4>A wonderful web agency</h4>
<Paragraph>
  During my third year at university, I co-founded <Link
    href="https://bambuu.dk"
    target="_blank">bambuu</Link
  >
  with my two buddies
  <Link href="https://twitter.com/GeeWengel" target="_blank">Gustav</Link>
  and
  <Link
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silas-roswall-0a2a587a"
    target="_blank"
  >
    Silas</Link
  >, a fast-paced web agency building products and prototypes larger
  corporations that were stuck in their old ways. I was the project manager and
  <em>main frontend developer</em>, but had my fair share of ventures into
  <em>Node.js and Java backends</em>. We had <em>fun</em> and we learned
  <em>a lot</em>, but in the end the consulting business wasn't that exciting.
</Paragraph>
<h4>A wasted waste SaaS</h4>
<Paragraph>
  Instead, we moved on and founded Reccoon, a SaaS with the missions of making
  waste management more environmental friendly. It was a great adventure
  building our own product from scratch. I was in charge of building a kick ass
  administration dashboard in
  <em>React</em>, along with a cross-platform companion app with
  <em>React Native</em>. We also did some consulting on the side, where I built
  backends in <em>Node.js</em>, while my colleague built the frontend.
  Unfortunately Reccoon didn't work out in the end, mainly do to businessy
  stuff, and us being a little to eager to build cool stuff, instead of actually
  looking at the market's needs.

<h4>An exciting education SaaS</h4>
<Paragraph>
  I've also co-founded <Link href="https://unihelper.dk" target="_blank">
    UniHelper
  </Link>, a SaaS that matches university students into groups in an effort to
  give them a better start on their journey. My main focus is developing the
  product which is a Next.js site, a backoffice CLI along with integrating with
  other services such as TypeForm (All the work I do at UniHelper is in my spare
  time though). I think we're quite successful actually, and both the
  universities and the students love it.
</Paragraph>
<h4>A grateful grown-up</h4>
<Paragraph>
  I've also done some consulting for LEGO which was really fun. On the frontend
  I helped build the first prototypes of their internal design system, and I was
  building a full GraphQL backend with AWS Lambdas and everything that requires.
  I'm pretty sure it was the wrong tool for the job but it was a learning
  experience for sure. If you bang hard enough on a screw, eventually it will
  turn into a nail.

  absolutely love working in the Storybook team, utilizing and expanding all my
  JavaScript knowledge and engaging with the open source community and users.
  All while building a tool I've made heavy use of myself throughout my whole
  career.
