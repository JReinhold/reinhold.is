  <p>
    I've always <strong>loved</strong> tinkering with software, electronics and
    engaging with the open source community. I currently work as an Open Sourcerer
    🧙‍♂️ at <a href="https://chromatic.com" target="_blank">Chromatic</a>, spending
    all my time making
    <a href="https://storybook.js.org" target="_blank">Storybook 📚</a> better for
    everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy combining creativity and empathy to solve actual problems for real
    people, eg. by building excellent developer tooling, UX focused interfaces or
    facilitating communication between different stakeholders. I have a background
    in the intersection between development and design, but most of my career has
    gravitated towards frontend development and the JavaScript ecosystem.
