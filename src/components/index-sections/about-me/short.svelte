  I've always <strong>loved</strong> tinkering with software, electronics and
  engaging with the open source community. I currently work as an Open Sourcerer
  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è at <a href="https://chromatic.com" target="_blank">Chromatic</a>, spending
  all my time making
  <a href="https://storybook.js.org" target="_blank">Storybook üìö</a> better for
  everyone.

<p>
  I enjoy combining creativity and empathy to solve actual problems for real
  people, eg. by building excellent developer tooling, UX focused interfaces or
  facilitating communication between different stakeholders. Out of pure luck
  this was also what my IT Product Development degree prepared me for, as it
  taught me the full spectrum from Computer Science to UX to business.
</p>
<p>I started my career in tech by co-founding a series of startups:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>bambuu</strong> - A fast-paced web-agency</li>
  <li><strong>Recoon</strong> - A SaaS for the waste hauling business</li>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://unihelper.dk" target="_blank">UniHelper</a></strong
    > - A SaaS for universities
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  While the success of the startups differ (UniHelper is still full steam
  ahead), they all contributed to who I am today and I've learned a ton about
  building products, teams and processes. I've also done some freelancing and
  recently dabbled with management as a Frontend Tech Lead at
  <a href="https://paperpal.com" target="_blank">Paperpal</a>.
