  I've always <strong>loved</strong> tinkering with software and electronics.
</p>
<p>I started my career in tech by co-founding a series of startups:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>bambuu</strong> - A fast-paced web-agency</li>
  <li><strong>Recoon</strong> - A SaaS for the waste hauling business</li>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://unihelper.dk" target="_blank">UniHelper</a></strong
    > - A SaaS for universities
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  While the success of the startups differ (UniHelper is still full steam
  ahead), they all contributed to who I am today and I've learned a ton about
  building products, teams and processes. I've also done some freelancing and
  I'm currently making use of all my skills as a Frontend Tech Lead at <a

  I enjoy combining creativity and empathy to solve actual problems for real
  people, eg. by building excelent developer tooling, UX focused interfaces or
  facilitating communication between different stakeholders. Out of pure luck
  this was also what my IT Product Development degree prepared me for, as it
  taught me the full spectrum from Computer Science to UX to business.

  I started my career in tech bu
  co-founding a bunch of startups with a couple of friends from university.
  During our Computer Science degree (and a few years after) we founded a
  fast-paced web agency. It was rather succesful but also quite boring in the
  end. We then went on to found a SaaS that would make it easier for waste
  haulers to manage their fleet. I had a lot of I started my career in tech

  in 2016, I co-founded
  <a href="https://bambuu.dk" target="_blank"> bambuu </a>
  , a digital agency doing web development and design. I was the project manager
  and
  <em>main frontend developer</em>, but had my fair share of ventures into
  <em>Node.js and Java backends</em>.

<p>
  In 2018 I co-founded
  <a href="https://reccoon.dk" target="_blank"> Reccoon </a>
  , a SaaS with the missions of making waste management more environmental friendly.
  I was in charge of building a kick ass administration dashboard in
  <em>React</em>, along with a cross-platform companion app with
  <em>React Native</em>. Unfortunately it didn't work out in the end, mainly do
  to businessy stuff.

<p>
  I've also co-founded
  <a href="https://unihelpr.dk" target="_blank"> UniHelpr </a>
  , a SaaS that matches university students into groups, in an effort to give them
  a better start on their journey. I'm building all the integrations and infrastructure
  that is surrounding the matching algorithm, using <em>Node.js</em>. It's quite
  successful actually.

<p>
  I want to build products and services that have a <em>positive</em>
  impact on the environmental and societal issues we are facing during the coming
  decades.
