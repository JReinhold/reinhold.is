  I've always <em>loved</em> tinkering with computers.
</p>
<p>
  During my Computer Science studies in 2016, I co-founded
  <a href="https://bambuu.dk" target="_blank"> bambuu </a>
  , a digital agency doing web development and design. I was the project manager and
  <em>main frontend developer</em>, but had my fair share of ventures into
  <em>Node.js and Java backends</em>.
</p>
<p>
  In 2018 I co-founded
  <a href="https://reccoon.dk" target="_blank"> Reccoon </a>
  , a SaaS with the missions of making waste management more environmental friendly. I was in charge
  of building a kick ass administration dashboard in <em>React</em>, along with a cross-platform
  companion app with <em>React Native</em>. Unfortunately it didn't work out in the end, mainly do
  to businessy stuff.
</p>
<p>
  I've also co-founded
  <a href="https://unihelpr.dk" target="_blank"> UniHelpr </a>
  , a SaaS that matches university students into groups, in an effort to give them a better start on
  their journey. I'm building all the integrations and infrastructure that is surrounding the matching
  algorithm, using <em>Node.js</em>. It's quite successful actually.
</p>
<p>
  I want to build products and services that have a <em>positive</em>
  impact on the environmental and societal issues we are facing during the coming decades.
