<p> For as long as I can remember, I've
    <em>loved</em> working with computers. When I
    was 11 years old I wanted to learn programming,
    so I grabbed my sister's university-level C++
    book and started coding. As I reached the
    concept of <em>classes</em>, I thought to
    myself:
</p>
<blockquote> <i> Oh no, I have no idea what's going
        on here, I'm not smart enough for this
        programming thing. </i> </blockquote>
<p> 10 years later, in 2015, when I had gotten bored
    in the army, and started my Computer Science
    degree, I realised that I actually wasn't
    <em>completely</em> useless, C++ just wasn't the
    best language to learn as a 11 year old newbie.

<p> I also realised that there was something called
    <em>Interaction Design/UX/Product Design</em>,
    and that I'd always had a passion for it, I just
    didn't knew it was a thing. I always thought the
    voice in my head was generally annoyed by the
    world, when in fact all it did was keep pointing
    out all the mistakes designers had made in the
    environment around me.

<p> During my third year at university, I
    co-founded <a href="https://bambuu.dk"
        target="_blank">bambuu</a> with my
    two buddies <a href="https://twitter.com/GeeWengel"
        target="_blank"> Gustav </a> and
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silas-roswall-0a2a587a"
        target="_blank"> Silas</a>, a digital
    agency doing web development and design for
    larger corporations that were stuck in their old
    ways. I was the project manager and <em>main
        frontend developer</em>, but had my fair
    share of ventures into <em>Node.js and Java
        backends</em>. We had <em>fun</em> and
    we learned <em>a lot</em>, but in the end the
    consulting business wasn't that exciting.
</p>
<p> Instead, we moved on and founded <a
        href="https://reccoon.dk" target="_blank">
        Reccoon </a> , a SaaS with the missions of
    making waste management more environmental
    friendly. It was a great adventure building our
    own product from scratch. I was in charge of
    building a kick ass administration dashboard in
    <em>React</em>, along with a cross-platform
    companion app with <em>React Native</em>. We
    also did some consulting on the side, where I
    built backends in <em>Node.js</em>, while
    my colleague built the frontend. Unfortunately
    Reccoon didn't work out in the end, mainly do to
    businessy stuff, and us being a little to eager
    to build cool stuff, instead of actually looking
    at the market's needs.
</p>
<p> I've also co-founded <a href="https://unihelpr.dk"
        target="_blank">
        UniHelpr </a> , a SaaS that matches
    university students into groups, in an effort to
    give them a better start on their journey. I'm
    building all the integrations (with services
    such as Google Sheets and TypeForm), and
    infrastructure (it's a Node.js CLI) that is
    surrounding the matching algorithm. It's quite
    successful actually, and both the universities
    and the students love it. </p>
<p> I want to build products and services that have
    a <em>positive</em> impact on the
    environmental and societal issues we are facing
    during the coming decades. </p>
<p> I've become very aware of my actions and the
    consequences they have on my surroundings. I
    love the beauty of nature, and I want to spend
    as much of my energy as possible on making sure
    we preserve that beauty for future generations.
</p>
<p> It isn't about the earth, it <em>will</em>
    endure no matter what we do to it. It's about my
    future children, grandchildren, and
    great-grandchildren. It's about making sure that
    <em>they</em> get to experience the same
    beautiful nature that I do.
